Question:->     

            What is library ?   
                1.  A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. 
                2.  The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is reused repeatedly.    
                3.  React is a library.
                4.  library are small code which is designed for small task or an action.
                5.  No inversion of control.


            What is framework ?
                1.  A framework is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms.
                2.  Multiple library combined to build a framework.
                3.  inversion of control.
                4.  Django is a framework.
                5.  Angular is considered a framework because it offers strong opinions as to how your application should be structured.




Frameworks and libraries are code written by third parties to solve regular/common problems or to optimise performance. 


A key difference between the two is the inversion of control. 


When using a library, the control remains with the developer who tells the application when to call library functions.


When using a framework, the control is reversed, which means that the framework tells the developer where code needs to be provided and calls it as it requires.
